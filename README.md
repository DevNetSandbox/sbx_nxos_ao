# DevNet Always On Open NX-OS Programmability Sandbox 

Here you will find Sample Code, Scripts and Information for use in the [DevNet Always On Open NX-OS Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/dae38dd8-e8ee-4d7c-a21c-6036bed7a804?diagramType=Topology). 

[DevNet Sandboxes](http://developer.cisco.com/sandbox) are all about providing an environment where developers can explore and test out whatever they are learning or working on.  But sometimes having a starting point, or inspiration can be helpful, and that's what this repository is all about.  

And should you develop some interesting code targeting the Sandbox and want to share with the community, we'd love to include it here!!! Just fork the repo and review our [Pull Request instructions](pull-requests.md).  

# Repo Resources
