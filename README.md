# DevNet Always On Open NX-OS Programmability Sandbox 

Here you will find Sample Code, Scripts and Information for use in the [DevNet Always On Open NX-OS Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/dae38dd8-e8ee-4d7c-a21c-6036bed7a804?diagramType=Topology). 

[DevNet Sandboxes](http://developer.cisco.com/sandbox) are all about providing an environment where developers can explore and test out whatever they are learning or working on.  But sometimes having a starting point, or inspiration can be helpful, and that's what this repository is all about.  

And should you develop some interesting code targeting the Sandbox and want to share with the community, we'd love to include it here!!! Just fork the repo and review our [Pull Request instructions](pull-requests.md).  

# Repo Resources 

## Learning Labs

This sandbox is leveraged in different NX-OS Learning Labs.  Within the [learning_labs](learning_labs/) directory are different code samples used in these learning labs.  Feel free to explore these samples on their own, or use the sandbox along with the Learning Labs.  

## Ansible Playbooks

Ansible is a great technology for Configuration Management of the network, and we've provided some sample playbooks to take a look at.  Take a look at what's available here:  [ansible-playbooks/README.md](ansible-playbooks/README.md).
